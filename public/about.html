<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Patterson, California in the year of 1985.  I moved around a lot during my childhood.  I've been to
  8 different schools all the way up to my adolescent years.  I come from a big family.  During my childhood, I was filled with a lot of curiousity.
  I went through life trying new things out just to see what excitement came from it.  My favorite area of study during my 
  child hood was history.  I fell in love with history because I liked to hear what the world was like before me.  My second 
  favorite area of study was anything to do with computers.  I liked computers because of the technology aspect.  I learned how to 
  keyboard in my freshman year of high school and was really good at it.  My junior year, I got into programming and surprised
  my instructor with some of the stuff I was able to come up with.  My senior year of high school, I studied Cisco Networking.
  I graduated in 2003 and decided to continue my education at Merced College.  I was the first one in my immediate family to attend 
  college.  My goal was to get an Associate's Degree in Computer Engineering.  That did not pan out as well because I started 
  working and was making more money outside of school, which led to me dropping out of college.  I dropped out because I didn't know 
  what I wanted to with my career anymore and lost the motivation to continue my studies.

<p>My first job was a Custodian at Merced College.  The pay wasn't much because it was part-time.  I bounced around a janitorial jobs 
  after I left Merced College.  I tried to get into warehousing, but I never was selected for an interview.  I eventually made my way 
  into the Automotive field.  I didn't know much about Automotive except changing oil and maybe doing a brake job at home.  My first job 
  in the Automotive field was Lower Bay Technician for Jiffy Lube.  All I did there was drain the oil and change the filter on vehicles.
  I learned how to change tires at Wal-Mart.  I bounced around a few Automotive shops because I was always looking for a place
  with actual opportunity advancement.  All of my past experiences have led me to acquire a Technician job at a Dealership.
  After over a dozen years working in the Automotive field, I have an itch to get back into Web Development.

<p>As you can tell I've moved around a lot as a child and as an adult.  I have learned a lot throughout my lifetime.
  I didn't always find success in everything I set out to do, but I gave everything my all.  One thing I've learned is that 
  it is never too late to start over.  The world has a lot to offer, you just have to keep exploring every avenue possible
  until you find your passion.  Life was never meant to be easy.  You may experience some tough times along the way, but that 
  just builds character.  It makes you hungrier for success.
